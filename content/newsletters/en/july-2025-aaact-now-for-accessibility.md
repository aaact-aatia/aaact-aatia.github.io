## 3D Printing: A Game-Changer in Accessibility Tools

3D printing is transforming the way accessibility tools are created, offering new possibilities for disability inclusion. This technology can bridge gaps where commercial solutions fall short, delivering fast, affordable, and tailored solutions. 

For many, 3D-printed tools have significantly improved their daily lives. From adaptive switches that replace the need for a keyboard or mouse, to custom dexterity aids or braille labels, these tools can be designed for one user but often go on to help many others with similar challenges.  

One of the greatest advantages of 3D printing is its ability to quickly address gaps in the market. The range of accessibility barriers people face is vast, and not every helpful solution has been invented. 3D printing empowers us to create and share tools rapidly and inexpensively, filling urgent needs until more permanent options are available.  

At AAACT, we provide GC employees with customized workplace support and adaptive solutions. While 3D printing isn’t necessary for everyone, our team can help identify and access the best assistive technologies, 3D-printed or otherwise, to meet your specific needs.

## Accessibility by Default: Building Inclusive Digital Experiences from the Ground Up with GC Forms 

At the heart of inclusive digital services lies a simple but powerful approach: accessibility by default. Rather than fixing or adding accessibility features after development, integrating accessibility from the start ensures a smoother, more efficient process and a better result for all users. 

Recently, our AAACT team had the pleasure of welcoming our colleagues from GC Forms, at the Canadian Digital Service, as guests on our *Accessible Horizons* podcast. Together, we explored how GC Forms was created with accessibility at its core. Since 2021, it has evolved into a dynamic tool enabling government employees to build accessible forms tailored to their needs. 

What sets GC Forms apart is its commitment to making accessibility the default. Designers and developers collaborated early to identify potential issues and define requirements before coding began. While ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, they went further by using a collaborative design tool and conducting automated and manual testing, including real user feedback. Third-party testing also helped uncover additional issues. This approach integrated planning, coding, and testing from the very start. One key takeaway is that while meeting standards is important, human intervention and user testing are essential to truly understand and address real user needs and experiences. 

Looking ahead, GC Forms is focusing on improving post-publication editing, managing multiple forms across teams, and maintaining its commitment to accessibility through ongoing feedback and iteration. 

If you’re a public servant interested in helping shape the future of accessible digital tools, we invite you to sign up to the GC Forms mailing list at [GC Forms Contact us web page](https://forms-formulaires.alpha.canada.ca/en/contact) for updates and to learn about future opportunities to contribute. 

For the full conversation with the GC Forms team, stay tuned for episode 6 of [*Accessible Horizons* podcast](https://aaact.canada.ca/podcasts/).
