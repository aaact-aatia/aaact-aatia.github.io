## 3D Printing: A Game-Changer in Accessibility Tools

</div>
</div>
3D printing is transforming the way accessibility tools are created, offering new possibilities for disability inclusion. This technology can bridge gaps where commercial solutions fall short, delivering fast, affordable, and tailored solutions. 

For many, 3D-printed tools have significantly improved their daily lives. From adaptive switches that replace the need for a keyboard or mouse, to custom dexterity aids or braille labels, these tools can be designed for one user but often go on to help many others with similar challenges.  

One of the greatest advantages of 3D printing is its ability to quickly address gaps in the market. The range of accessibility barriers people face is vast, and not every helpful solution has been invented. 3D printing empowers us to create and share tools rapidly and inexpensively, filling urgent needs until more permanent options are available.  

At AAACT, we provide GC employees with customized workplace support and adaptive solutions. While 3D printing isn’t necessary for everyone, our team can help identify and access the best assistive technologies, 3D-printed or otherwise, to meet your specific needs.

## Accessibility by Default: Building Inclusive Digital Experiences from the Ground Up with GC Forms 

At the heart of inclusive digital services lies a simple but powerful approach: accessibility by default. Rather than fixing or adding accessibility features after development, integrating accessibility from the start ensures a smoother, more efficient process and a better result for all users. 

Recently, our AAACT team had the pleasure of welcoming our colleagues from GC Forms, at the Canadian Digital Service, as guests on our *Accessible Horizons* podcast. Together, we explored how GC Forms was created with accessibility at its core. Since 2021, it has evolved into a dynamic tool enabling government employees to build accessible forms tailored to their needs. 

What sets GC Forms apart is its commitment to making accessibility the default. Designers and developers collaborated early to identify potential issues and define requirements before coding began. While ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, they went further by using a collaborative design tool and conducting automated and manual testing, including real user feedback. Third-party testing also helped uncover additional issues. This approach integrated planning, coding, and testing from the very start. One key takeaway is that while meeting standards is important, human intervention and user testing are essential to truly understand and address real user needs and experiences. 

Looking ahead, GC Forms is focusing on improving post-publication editing, managing multiple forms across teams, and maintaining its commitment to accessibility through ongoing feedback and iteration. 

If you’re a public servant interested in helping shape the future of accessible digital tools, we invite you to sign up to the GC Forms mailing list at [GC Forms Contact us web page](https://forms-formulaires.alpha.canada.ca/en/contact) for updates and to learn about future opportunities to contribute.

As part of AAACT’s ongoing commitment to promote disability inclusion across the public service, we recently delivered a workshop titled \\*Creating an Inclusive Workplace Culture\\* to tour guides at the Supreme Court of Canada. This session aimed to deepen participants’ understanding of how a positive workplace culture supports inclusion for persons with disabilities, not only within the public service, but also in the experiences of Canadians who visit. By fostering respectful, accessible, and inclusive interactions, we ensure that everyone, regardless of ability, feels welcomed and valued. 

The workshop covered the three pillars of disability inclusion, environment, culture, and individual adjustments, highlighting how each contributes to breaking down barriers. Participants explored the power of inclusive language in challenging ableism and learned practical strategies to become effective allies. By embedding accessibility into daily practices and public interactions, tour guides are now better equipped to create inclusive experiences for all visitors, helping to build a more equitable and welcoming environment for both employees and the public they serve.

## Wayfinding and Signage in the Workplace: Creating Accessible Navigation for All 

Accessibility in the workplace goes beyond accommodations – it also means integrating disability-inclusive design into physical spaces, systems, and processes. 

Inclusive wayfinding is one example. It supports independence, safety, and accessibility by offering multiple ways to help people navigate and orient themselves, tailored to diverse needs and preferences. 

An inclusive wayfinding approach uses a combination of low-tech, mid-tech, and high-tech solutions, such as: 

Signage in multiple formats: 

* High-contrast visuals (e.g., light text on dark backgrounds) 
* Tactile graphics 
* Braille and raised print 
* Digital tags like QR codes and NFC tags that link to audio or detailed content via smartphones 

Navigation guides, such as: 

* tactile paths 
* high-contrast floor patterns 
* Tactile route indicator 
* auditory signals 
* other physical indicators that assist with orientation 

Digital navigation tools, including: 

* smartphone apps using camera recognition 
* Bluetooth beacon systems 
* LIDAR-enabled mapping to describe locations, nearby points of interest, and provide real-time, step-by-step directions. 

Each of these elements supports different needs. A single format won’t serve everyone – for instance, not all people who are blind read braille, and not all people with print disabilities use adaptive technologies the same way. That’s why a layered and flexible approach is essential for inclusive outcomes. 

AAACT works with departments and organizations to explore these topics, including incorporating a comprehensive wayfinding system into our own service centre to better support our clients. This initiative reflects our commitment to accessibility and to creating spaces where everyone can navigate independently and confidently. 

## Conversations That Matter: Unlocking Talent Through Inclusion 

In today’s diverse workplaces, inclusion isn’t just a value, it’s a leadership skill. It goes beyond policies and programs, it’s about everyday conversations that shape an environment where every employee, including those with disabilities, feels valued and empowered to contribute their best. 

### Why Conversations Matter 

True inclusion grows through authentic, ongoing dialogue. When managers learn to have open, meaningful conversations about accommodations, challenges, and strengths, they reveal hidden talents and remove barriers. Each conversation is an opportunity to foster a workplace where diversity thrives and drives success. 

### Empowering Managers with Practical Training 

Our workshop, *Conversations That Matter: Unlocking Talent Through Inclusion,* equips managers with practical tools and real-world scenarios. Participants learn how to: 

* navigate delicate topics around workplace accommodations 
* recognize and remove barriers to inclusion 
* foster a team culture that values diverse strengths and perspectives 
* identify helpful resources. 

If you want to develop inclusive leadership skills and create a workplace where everyone can succeed, this course is for you. To learn more or schedule training, contact us at [aaactlearning-aatiaapprentissage@ssc-spc.gc.ca](mailto:aaactlearning-aatiaapprentissage@ssc-spc.gc.ca) .  

Don’t miss this opportunity to create meaningful change, one conversation at a time.

## Digital Accessibility Hack – Making Accessible Emails 

<div class="row">\
<div class="col-md-6">

</div>\
</div>

In today's digital landscape, emails remain a powerful tool for communication. But amidst all the designs, links, and layouts, accessibility often gets overlooked. Creating accessible emails isn't just a nice-to-have; it's a necessity to ensure that your message reaches everyone, including those with disabilities. Accessible emails improve user experience, expand your audience reach, and show your commitment to inclusivity. 

Here are some essential tips to craft accessible emails: 

1. Use Descriptive Subject Lines: Make your subject line clear and concise, so recipients immediately understand the purpose of the email. 
2. Opt for HTML format as it offers several benefits, including structured content, text formatting, hyperlinks, and alternative text. Furthermore, using HTML format allows you to follow the accessibility guidelines like WCAG and EN 301 549. 
3. When creating a bilingual email, be sure to add a bookmark to let users skip to the section containing their language or choice. 
4. In a bilingual email, be sure to perform a language markup to help screen readers read the other language text properly. You can do this by highlighting the text you want to set to a different language, select the review tab, then select Language > Set Proofing Language. 
5. Plain language: Avoid overly complex writing styles, choose simple vocabulary, use short sentences, use an active voice, and define abbreviations the first time you use them. 
6. Choose Accessible Font Sizes and Styles: Opt for sans-serif fonts like Arial, Calibri, Verdana and Aptos. Ensure normal body text is 12 to 14 points. Avoid decorative or overly stylized fonts. 
7. Incorporate Alt Text for Images: Include alternative text that briefly describes the relevant content of the image. 
8. Provide Clear, Clickable Links: Use descriptive anchor text like “Download Report” instead of vague terms like “Click Here.” 
9. Testing for accessibility: While the accessibility checker is not a substitute for knowing how to create an accessible document, it can help identify some accessibility issues. Under the review tab, select **Check Accessibility**. 

Accessibility isn't just about compliance; it's about embracing diversity and ensuring equality in digital communication. By following these tips, you can design emails that resonate with all recipients, leaving no one behind.
