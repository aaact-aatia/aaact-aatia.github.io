NAAW, celebrated this year from May 25 to 31, offers a meaningful opportunity to explore accessibility and inclusion in the workplace, and to reaffirm our shared commitment to building a more inclusive public service.

Throughout the week, a variety of engaging activities will take place across the GC. We encourage everyone to take part, as this is a valuable chance to learn, collaborate and contribute to advancing accessibility in the public service and beyond.

Below is a list of planned events that are open to all GC employees, and we also encourage you to participate in activities hosted by your own departments.
