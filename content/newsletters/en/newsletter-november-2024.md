As we approach the 2024 International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD) on December 3rd, we take this opportunity to reflect on the importance of inclusivity and empowerment for individuals with disabilities. This year’s theme is "Stop the Stigma, a Call to Action". The Government of Canada (GC) is bringing a focus on the importance of understanding both apparent and non-apparent disabilities in the workplace. As we continue to foster an inclusive work environment, it’s important to recognize the diverse range of disabilities that our colleagues may experience, both apparent and non-apparent.  

Apparent disabilities may be visible and easy to recognize, such as physical or sensory disabilities. However, non-apparent disabilities that may not be visible can be equally impactful.  To create a supportive and inclusive work environment, we can approach all people with empathy and understanding and acknowledge that everyone’s experience is unique.
