“Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.”

**Martin Luther King Jr.**

</blockquote>

Welcome to edition 17 of the GC Workplace Accessibility Passport newsletter. December is here with its shorter days, its deluge of ads about sales, the prospect of celebrations with family and friends, and the opportunity to mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD). The United Nations theme for this year is "Amplifying the leadership of persons with disabilities for an inclusive and sustainable future." This theme recognizes the important role that persons with disabilities play in creating a more inclusive and sustainable world for all. It also emphasizes the importance of the participation of persons with disabilities in decision-making processes that affect their lives.

Accessible and inclusive workplaces are the key, and that key is ready for each of us to seize.

I have spent the last several years applying what I have learned through lived experience of disability, listening to many people whose experiences differ from mine, and working as an accessibility professional. I know the message is sometimes difficult to hear, I often feel like a broken record, accessibility is more than a principle in a policy, a word on a PowerPoint presentation, or a checkmark on a list. Accessibility removes barriers and reduces stigma, it affords independence and dignity, not to mention all the economic reasons why it just makes sense. Why then is accessibility still an uphill battle in 2024?

You are probably reading this newsletter because your work and or your personal interests lead you to learn more about accessibility and workplace accommodation. Let’s heed Martin Luther King’s message and take concrete action, let’s create accessible products, at least when they are about accessibility. To support you in creating accessible content, this edition takes a different approach to our regular segment on accessibility tips. Read and share the first article of the new series on document accessibility. Please, come back for more!.

As partners in the Passport initiative, the Office of Public Service Accessibility (OPSA) and the Accessibility Accommodation and Adaptive Computer Technology (AAACT) teams thank each of you for reading and sharing this newsletter. We send you best wishes for a healthy and accessible future.

## Passport Adopters Corner

### Digital Passport Pilot

The pilot phase of the digital GC Workplace Accessibility Passport application is still progressing well. More than 150 employees have created digital Passports across 6 organizations.

The Office of Public Service Accessibility (OPSA) has extended the pilot phase to December 13 to ensure more participation and to gather additional feedback. Results from this will inform the development and the release of the digital Passport. Findings from this phase will be shared with the Adopter Community of Practice and on [GC Workplace Accessibility Passport/ Passeport d’accessibilité au lieu de travail du GC - GCpedia](https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/GC_Workplace_Accessibility_Passport/_Passeport_d%E2%80%99accessibilit%C3%A9_au_lieu_de_travail_du_GC "https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/GC_Workplace_Accessibility_Passport/_Passeport_d%E2%80%99accessibilit%C3%A9_au_lieu_de_travail_du_GC").

A sincere thank you to pilot organizations for their collaboration and participation!

### Passport Examples

The GC Workplace Accessibility Passport directly applies the social model of disability by documenting situations, barriers, and solutions. During a collaborative conversation with the manager, the Passport owner can focus the discussion on the work to be accomplished and the tools or measures needed to do this work. Let’s move away from the notion that the employee with a disability is the problem.

#### Example 1: Changes in work responsibilities

Situation: Alex is a Senior Advisor to a Director General at Justice Canada. A recent restructuring is resulting in new responsibilities for Alex and changes in business practices that will affect their work.

Barriers: Changes in roles and responsibilities create uncertainty. Adjusting to less predictable tasks, fluctuations in priorities and expectations can cause stress.

Solutions: Frequent communications about changes to the team, bilateral discussions between Alex and their DG about specific aspects of Alex’s work, clarifying expectations and adjusting timelines. Alex’s DG refers them to wellness resources in the organization and the Employee Assistance Program for ongoing support.

Alex and their DG both sign Alex’s [GC Workplace Accessibility Passport](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/government-canada-workplace-accessibility-passport/use/create.html "https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/government-canada-workplace-accessibility-passport/use/create.html") and commit to regular check-ins.

#### Example 2: Service dog in the workplace

Situation: Gena is a service agent. They screen clients for benefits and provide policy-related information. Gena works in the office full-time and has a trained service dog.

Barriers: Insufficient space for the service dog in most workstations Gena and her team can use, no easy way to reach area for the service dog to relieve itself, unassigned seating practices can result in environmental sensitivities for other team members.

Solutions: Assigned larger workstation, well established cleaning protocols for any common areas, collaboration with Facilities to identify space close to the building for the dog to relieve itself.

Gena records these solutions in their [GC Workplace Accessibility Passport](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/government-canada-workplace-accessibility-passport.html "https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service/government-canada-workplace-accessibility-passport.html"). Gina meets with their manager to discuss their Passport. Gena’s manager agrees to secure a larger workstation for her on a lower floor to allow easier access to enter and exit the building. The manager works with Facilities to find an accessible area for the dog outside the building. They also update the cleaning protocols for Gina’s workstation and any common areas.

## Interview with Nadine Charron

Nadine Charron is the Executive Director of the Accessibility Accommodation and Adaptive Computer Technology program at Shared Services Canada. In this interview, Nadine shares her vision for AAACT, information about the new AAACT space, and her unwavering dedication to equity and full participation of federal employees with disabilities.

Luna: Nadine, tell us more about who you are and what you do.

Nadine: I am the Executive Director of the Accessibility, Accommodation and Adaptive Computer Technology (AAACT) team, housed at Shared Services Canada (SSC). AAACT provides accessibility services to federal employees with disabilities and their organizations. AAACT’s activities fall within the following areas:

### Accessibility Learning

I am talking about training, we offer events and demonstrations of adaptive tools, we build awareness across departments.

### Individualized workplace adjustments

We offer information and advice to meet individual employee accommodation needs. That is a very popular item on our list of things that we do. I always say that I potentially have 360,000 clients across the public service because we like to open our doors to everyone. We try and support employees and managers alike to make the workplace accessible and inclusive.

### Digital accessibility services

Our digital accessibility services include testing and expert advice on document accessibility, applications, and websites, so that they meet Canadian standards, and everyone can interact with them.

### SSC’s Accessibility Plan

Our team leads the development of SSC’s Accessibility Plan to meet the legislative requirements of the Accessible Canada Act. We develop SSC’s annual progress report and manage the feedback mechanism, which collects comments from employees and clients. It's my wishful thinking that we reach 2040 with a barrier-free Canada as mentioned in the Act.

### Certification and special projects

We collaborate with partner departments to standardize accessibility reporting, to enable GC organizations to find accessibility testers, and to disseminate information about the recently adopted Canadian standard on accessibility of information and communication technology.

One of our most sought-after services is the provision of procurement advice to technical authorities throughout the Government of Canada. The goal is to ensure that anything the government is procuring is accessible. When vendors are not meeting accessibility standards from day one, there is an opportunity to create a road map to make the product accessible. We help technical authorities show vendors how to create such a roadmap.

We also collaborate with other countries to support the implementation of digital accessibility standards.

Luna: I have the privilege of working closely with you and I know how passionate and committed you are to this work. How do you manage to remain motivated, given the fact that progress is not always as fast as we'd like it to be in this area?

Nadine: That's an excellent question.

We work together, so it's sometimes easy for you to see the frustrations that I feel because progress is so slow. But the days where we are able to help someone and they walk away from the office or from the virtual meeting saying, “Oh my goodness, someone heard me, someone helped me, I can now work and be productive,” that is what drives me every day! Even when we're delivering training, those little aha moments when you see the spark in people's eyes, because they understand that they can do this now is what brings me back day in, day out. At the end of the day, we help remove obstacles and we see the burden being lifted from a person's shoulders. I know that I've made a difference. Let's come back tomorrow and do it again.

Luna: Your team is helping SSC deliver on its accessibility plan. What, in your view is the key to success for an organization’s accessibility plan?

Nadine: It has to be meaningful. An accessibility plan can't be words in a document or a check mark on a report. It needs to hold the organization accountable, and progress has to be measurable. Actions must be very specific, so no broad strokes. It's not enough to say “I am going to add accessibility to all my competitive processes this year” or mentioning on the poster that candidates can request accommodations. The entire hiring process must be accessible and inclusive.

Luna: SSC provides a broad range of information technology products and services to federal organizations. What should SSC do to ensure these products and services are accessible and inclusive?

Nadine: We need to walk the talk. If we're not providing an accessible service, how do we expect the Government of Canada to follow suit? I think AAACT must continue providing information and educating SSC branches so they can integrate accessibility from the start.

Luna: Let’s now turn our attention to AAACT’s new space. I know how excited you and the members of the team are. Can you please tell our readers about the new facility?

Nadine: My vision for that space is that everyone who walks through it, leaves happy. A bit like an Apple store which is buzzing with activity, where you can easily find information, try out the products and learn how they work. When you walk through that beautiful client space that's been built for us, our experts will show you a broad range of tools we have on hand and how they function, instead of saying “If you have ADHD, you should use this tool.”

It's about looking at the different tools, seeing how they work, and allowing people to ask questions. We're also fortunate to have a sensory room clients can use if they are anxious, or they just want to sit and think in a space that provides a different sensory experience. I hope that one day there will be other similar spaces in other regions.

Luna: Yes, the sensory room is truly a fabulous example. What are other accessibility features the new space has to offer?

Nadine: Most of the floor is vinyl. We have moved away from carpets with patterns and ensured good colour contrast everywhere. Lighting in boardrooms and closed offices are fully adjustable, so are desks and chairs. Kitchen counters, microwave ovens, electrical outlets, and many other aspects have been designed with accessibility in mind.

One of my favorite things that we are working on right now is the signage. So, signage will be no tech, low tech and high tech. Signs on the wall will be high contrast, tactile, in Braille and digital.

Luna: It’s wonderful to hear the enthusiasm in your voice. I have also noticed how much effort you put to ensure the space is clean and beautiful. So, accessible can be beautiful, right?

Nadine: It definitely is a beautiful space. More often than not, I am in the office five days a week because I love this space. It is welcoming. I walk around several times a day to make sure clients and staff can feel at home. For example, we regularly welcome an employee with a service dog in training. We have to be conscious of people with allergies, so the floors are washed every day, and any carpets are vacuumed as soon as the dog leaves. We are proud to offer tours to colleagues in and outside of SSC. It encourages others to learn about accessibility features and to implement them in their own facilities.

Luna: In closing, please tell us about upcoming exciting events AAACT will offer.

Nadine: Our state-of-the-art classroom in this space will be used to its full extent. We will offer workshops about culture change, information sessions and skills development for clients, training for application developers and much more, as part of our learning strategy. We are developing a podcast so that we can share information, and we can share this space with other people on a regular basis.

Luna: Thank you, Nadine, for sharing your thoughts, your vision, and for so eloquently describing AAACT’s new space!

### OPSA Measurement Workshops

To strengthen the GC’s capacity to measure progress in accessibility, the Office of Public Service Accessibility (OPSA) and Statistics Canada hosted a series of workshops for individuals working on accessibility plans and progress reports. More than 500 participants attended these workshops, a great reflection of the dedication of the GC accessibility community.

For more information, materials from the workshop will be posted on the [Data Measurement Page](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gcpedia.gc.ca%2Fwiki%2FData_and_Measurement%2F_Donn%25C3%25A9es_et_mesure%3Fsetlang%3Den%26uselang%3Den&data=05%7C02%7CShawn.Thompson%40ssc-spc.gc.ca%7C9d6b5de3e61e4e31468708dd66264f0f%7Cd05bc19494bf4ad6ae2e1db0f2e38f5e%7C0%7C0%7C638779036909889359%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=qjaODoekzu1bVt8Z6bZ604hn9B%2F7zYhkpdHiHGtG%2FYo%3D&reserved=0 "https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gcpedia.gc.ca%2Fwiki%2FData_and_Measurement%2F_Donn%25C3%25A9es_et_mesure%3Fsetlang%3Den%26uselang%3Den&data=05%7C02%7CShawn.Thompson%40ssc-spc.gc.ca%7C9d6b5de3e61e4e31468708dd66264f0f%") on the [Accessibility hub](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gcpedia.gc.ca%2Fgcwiki%2Findex.php%3Ftitle%3DOffice_of_Public_Service_Accessibility%2F_Bureau_de_l%25E2%2580%2599accessibilit%25C3%25A9_au_sein_de_la_fonction_publique%26redirect%3Dno&data=05%7C02%7CShawn.Thompson%40ssc-spc.gc.ca%7C9d6b5de3e61e4e31468708dd66264f0f%7Cd05bc19494bf4ad6ae2e1db0f2e38f5e%7C0%7C0%7C638779036909914964%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=LIpv2BZ42rNojOG1G3jU2ignVIvupagzEbxRWM2%2F6Rk%3D&reserved=0 "https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gcpedia.gc.ca%2Fgcwiki%2Findex.php%3Ftitle%3DOffice_of_Public_Service_Accessibility%2F_Bureau_de_l%25E2%2580%2599accessibilit%25C3%25A9_au_sein_de_la_fonction_publique%26redirect%3Dno&d").

### Learning About Accessibility and Inclusion

This year’s IDPD was celebrated in the public service with many inspiring presentations and practical events. Some highlights include:

-   An engaging session led by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and hosted by the Canada School of Public Service, featuring Rick Hansen, an iconic figure in the area of accessibility, as well as a panel discussing the lived experiences of people with non apparent disabilities, led by Tina Namiesniowski, Deputy Minister Champion for federal employees with disabilities.
-   A smartshop for human resource practitioners, organized by the Human Resources Council (HRC). The HRC partnered with the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer (OCHRO), OPSA, and AAACT to share practical advice on workplace accommodation.
-   The first of a new series of short (30 min) video broadcasts hosted by AAACT, highlighting the new accessible space for clients in the National Capital Region, a demonstration of adaptive technologies, and a live conversation about a topic related to workplace accommodation. More information about the series and how to access recordings and transcripts will appear in the next edition of this newsletter.
-   AAACT also designed and delivered a new interactive training workshop on culture change to employees of the Supreme Court of Canada. Stay tuned for more offerings of this unique learning session that gets at the fundamentals of creating a respectful and inclusive workplace culture.

### New Canadian Accessible Employment Standard

Canada has a brand-new employment accessibility standard and that is one important milestone to celebrate in the wake of IDPD 2024. Accessibility Standards Canada (ASC) has published the [CAN/ASC-1.1:2024 – Employment standard](https://accessible.canada.ca/creating-accessibility-standards/canasc-112024-employment?mode=full-html#s10.3 "https://accessible.canada.ca/creating-accessibility-standards/canasc-112024-employment?mode=full-html#s10.3"), a framework aimed at removing barriers to accessibility in the workplace.

The standard addresses organizational policies, systems, and leadership. It focuses on key aspects of the entire employment lifecycle, including recruitment, hiring, onboarding, retention, and career development.

The Standard also details the key components for a successful employment accessibility strategy.

The new employment standard provides a framework for all Canadian employers to create workplaces where everyone can find opportunities and contribute to our society.

### Bridging the Gap

[Bridging The Gap - Report on Disability Inclusion in Canadian Workplaces - Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/disability-inclusion-business-council/report-bridging-gap.html "https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/disability-inclusion-business-council/report-bridging-gap.html")  recently published by the Disability Inclusion Business Council (DIBC), provides advice to Canadian employers.

Established in December 2022, the DIBC is an advisory body composed of 10 senior executives of Canadian businesses. Its mandate is to advise the Minister of Diversity, Inclusion, and Persons with Disabilities and to champion disability inclusion in the business community.

The DIBC report states that employers recognize the competitive advantage of inclusive workplaces. The challenge remains getting from understanding to action. Six recommendations address awareness and training, universal design, the importance of ethical artificial intelligence, and the need to set standards and measure progress. On the topic of workplace accommodation, the report an approach that offers employees adjustments by default, rather than relying on disclosure.

The DIBC encourages the GC to lead by example and to share lessons learned.

## Spotlight on Document Accessibility

Document accessibility is everyone’s responsibility. Moreover, in addition to some very handy features in the applications we use on a regular basis, a wealth of resources and practical advice are at our fingertips. The following article is part of a regular “Spotlight on Document Accessibility” series that will appear in the Passport newsletter.

We will begin this series by exploring the topic of images and graphics in documents.

### Are images or graphics accessible? Should we avoid them?

Photos, charts, or icons add valuable content to documents. They make information easier to understand and, when designed or selected with the user in mind, help focus attention and make the document generally more appealing.

### What can you do to make images or graphics accessible?

Did you know that a significant number of document users don’t have access to the images or graphics they contain? People who rely on adaptive technologies, such as text to speech or magnification, those with slower Internet connections will not have access to images.  Complex, unfamiliar images, or graphics with poor colour contrast may be more difficult to see or understand. The solution? Alternative text or alt text. The goal is to ensure that anyone reading alt text can get the same information from the description of an image as someone who relies on the visuals.

Alt text does not affect how an image is displayed. It provides the content in an alternative text-based format. Alt text is a brief description that conveys the content and meaning of an image. It is one of the easiest document accessibility techniques but getting it right can be difficult.

When writing alt text for an image, consider different factors including:

-   Its topic and purpose: will any of the content’s meaning be lost if the image can’t be viewed? Is the image purely decorative?
-   Its function in the document: Is the information conveyed by the image necessary or important for the user?
-   Any related information already included in the document: for example if the image contains text, is this text elsewhere in the document?

There are three types of images:

-   Simple images
-   Complex images
-   Decorative images

### Does every image need alt text?

No. Some images or graphics are only added to make the layout of the document more visually interesting. Those are known as “decorative images” and should be labelled as such.

A "decorative" image is one that

-   does not present important content,
-   is used for layout or non-informative purposes, and
-   does not have a function (e.g., is not a link).

Examples of decorative images are borders, line breaks and brand graphics.

### How to write alt text

There are useful guidelines for writing alt text but most of them apply to webpages. For non web-based content, adding “bad” alt text is still better than adding none at all. The following tips will help you develop alt text for images in your documents.

Think first and foremost about what the reader needs or would like to know about the image. Writing alt text is all about context. Being aware of how the image is presented and the context in which it sits will give any user a better experience. If you are adding alt text to an image of a painting, you might want to consider if the style of painting is important, does knowing the painter’s name add value? What aspects of the painting are relevant to the rest of the document?

Alt text should:

-   be specific and not overly descriptive.
-   Be concise, but describe what’s in your images accurately enough to understand their context. If the graphic displays numbers or a trend or quantitative information, the alt text should as well. For example, a phrase like “Bar chart showing hirings for 2024” is brief but does not give readers enough detail.
-   Avoid repetition.
-   Never start with “image of” or “picture of”.
-   Include any essential text or data that’s part of the visual.
-   Images that already have a caption describing the image, may not need additional alt text.
-   Describe information, not esthetics. For example, alt text for an icon should describe what it represents rather than what it looks like.
-   Use simple punctuation.
-   Don’t include acronyms, links, URLs, or bulleted lists.

For complex images such as data charts, provide a long description elsewhere in the document.

To add alt text to a simple image:

-   write a short description with the alt text function in the application you are using to create or modify the document
-   include a short description of the image directly on the page

To add alt text to a complex image:

-   write a short description with the alt text function in the application you are using to create or modify the document
-   include a short description of the image directly on the page
-   Develop a detailed description of the image that you can access via a link The long description can be placed elsewhere in the document.

Don’t rely on automatically generated alt text. Always review and edit the alt text as needed.
