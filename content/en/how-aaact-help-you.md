				<p>AAACT offers a wide range of adaptations, alternate approaches, tools, training, services, resources and adaptive computer technologies for public service employees with disabilities or injuries. It allows you to explore, experiment, and learn about, inclusive design, collaborative workplaces and adaptive solutions. This can include:</p>
				<ul>
						<li>changes to font sizes </li>
						<li>alternate workplace setups to reduce strain and injury </li>
						<li>new tools such as keyboards or mice</li>

				</ul>
				<p>Adaptive computer technology is any hardware or software that enables a person with a disability or injury to use a computer, tablet, phone or other digital devices who could not use it otherwise. This is done by changing the way the computer interacts with users or the way users interact with the computer. The solutions may include specific tools, techniques, or strategies in addition to software or hardware.</p>
				<p>There are over 130 software packages and 4000 different technical aids in use across the federal public service. These are needed to respond to a wide variety of vision, hearing, cognitive, learning, physical, and other disability-related requirements.</p>
				<h2>The Lending Library pilot project</h2>
				<p>The <a href="/en/shared-services/corporate/aaact-program/lending-library-service-pilot-project.html">Lending Library pilot project</a> is a fast-tracked accommodations process put in place to quickly provide adaptive hardware, software, resources and tools to public service employees. The Lending Library aims to address barriers that delay access to specialized services and workplace adjustments needed by:</p>
				<ul class="lst-spcd">
						<li>Determinate employees with disabilities or injuries allowing them to focus on their job and training, gain valuable work experiences during their terms and deliver services to Canadians (determinate employees are employed on a temporary basis and include students, interns, casual and term employees).</li>
						<li>Determinate and indeterminate employees who remain at work when they are experiencing the short-term or occasional effects of a disability, injury or illness.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The service provides ongoing support by AAACT to employees and their managers. Team performance depends on all members having the tools to deliver on priorities together.</p>
				<h2>AAACT services</h2>
