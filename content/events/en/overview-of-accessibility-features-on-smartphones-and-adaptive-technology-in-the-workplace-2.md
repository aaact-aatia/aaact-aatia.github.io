This learning activity includes three segments: two presentations and a questions and answers session.

The Accessibility, Accommodations and Adaptive Computer Technology (AAACT) team will highlight the accessibility features that are built into Android and iOS devices and that can be used on your Government of Canada-issued smartphone.

The team will also give a brief overview of the types of adaptive technology in use on GC computers and how they assist in removing barriers to accessibility.

Participants will learn about:

- accessibility features on iOS and Android smartphones
- accessibility features built into Windows 10 and Microsoft 365
- other accessibility tools for Windows 10 that are available in the marketplace
- non-ITÂ solutions to removing accessibility barriers, such as furniture, lighting and so on

The AAACT team will answer questions from participants and, upon request, is prepared to demonstrate how most of the adaptive technology works.
