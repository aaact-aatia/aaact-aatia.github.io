<p>At Shared Services Canada (<abbr>SSC</abbr>), the Accessibility, Accommodation, and Adaptive Computer Technology (<abbr>AAACT</abbr>) Program is dedicated to fostering a more inclusive and accessible workplace across the Government of Canada. Through our past learning events, we have engaged public servants in meaningful discussions and hands-on training that break down barriers and build awareness.</p>
