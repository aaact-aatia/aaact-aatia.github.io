Since 1988, the Government of Canada’s Communication Policy requires everyone in government to use plain language when they write. This requirement is part of the 2016 [Policy on Communications and Federal Identity](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=30683) and the [Canada.ca content style guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-style-guide.html), as well.

The new [Accessible Canada Act](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-0.6/page-2.html#docCont) enshrines the need for plain language writing into law. [Accessibility Standards Canada](https://accessible.canada.ca/) is setting plain language standards for all federally-regulated organizations. This includes Parliament and the Public Service.

During this 3-hour workshop on the principles of plain language, you will learn the small changes that can make a big difference to your writing style. For example, you will:

* Learn about the need for plain language, the benefits of plain language, the top plain language tips.
* Put the tips to work.
