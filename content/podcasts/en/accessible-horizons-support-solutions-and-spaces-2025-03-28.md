  Part 1: Spotlight on 219 Laurier

  Join us for a virtual tour of the AAACT classroom at 219 Laurier, where inclusive design meets innovation. Discover how this space has been built with accessibility in mind—featuring ergonomic setups, adaptive tools, and a welcoming environment tailored to meet diverse needs.


  Part 2: Seeing Possibilities – CCTV Technology

  What exactly is a CCTV in the accessibility world? We break down how these powerful devices support people with low vision by magnifying text and images in real time. Tune in as we explore the different types of Digital magnifiers, the barriers they help remove, and how they’re transforming access to printed materials.


  Part 3: Conversations That Matter – Nadine & Luna

  In this candid discussion between two experienced managers, we dive into the nuances of complex accommodation cases. One manager seeks guidance on how to handle an employee's medical note. Unsure about next steps, including involving labour relations, they turn to a trusted peer for support. The resulting conversation is honest, empathetic, and packed with practical advice for leaders navigating similar situations.


  Whether you’re a manager, employee, or accessibility champion, this episode offers valuable insights and tools to help create a more inclusive workplace.

Welcome to Accessible Horizons, a podcast series about how to build a barrier free and inclusive public service. Join your hosts. Accessibility experts Nadine Charron and Luna Bengio from the Accessibility, Accommodation and Adaptive Computer Technology (AAACT) program for a lively discussion and lots of practical tips.

**Nadine**

Good morning Luna.

**Luna**

Good morning Nadine. It's a pleasure to be here. This is episode three of Accessible Horizon. I can't believe we made it all this way to episode three. This was a dream not too long ago, so it's a pleasure to be here with you this morning. And we have a great, program for you. All of you. Thank you for tuning in.

Thank you for participating into the webinar. And before we get started, I want to introduce somebody, our special guest. We have a special silent guest today. And her name is Celeste. And she is, she is kind of the mascot of our Accessible Horizons podcast. And I'm trying to do this. My apologies to the people who, watch the sound and, the video in this podcast because it's hard for me to do things with only one hand and holding the mic, but here I'm holding Celeste up.

She's a stuffed, animal. She's very cuddly. And her particular thing is that she has Accessible Horizons written in Braille. On her belly, she's blue and her belly is white. So here we go. But wait a.

**Nadine**

Minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You're going too fast. Here. It's blue. What's so important about blue?

**Luna**

Well, first of all, blue is my favorite color.

**Nadine**

Okay.

**Luna**

And the second is yours.

**Nadine**

It is mine. I have a Jeep, and my jeep is white and blue. So our mascot is very fitting and it's embroidered in purple. What's important about purple?

**Luna**

Well, because purple is commonly, representing, people with disabilities and inclusion of people with disabilities. I think it's recognized internationally as the color. And it's a beautiful color, so.

**Nadine**

Well, it's certainly a so all of our favorite things and one thing. Well and very cool. Absolutely. But let's get on with the show shall we?

**Luna**

Well, yes. And today we have, an interesting show. So first of all, we're coming to you from the classroom. We decided that for each of these episodes, we'd show you one of the aspects of our space here in Ottawa for, 219 Laurier. The space for the Accessibility, Accommodation and Adaptive Computer Technology program. And today we are in the classroom.

**Luna**

And so, Nadine, you're going to tell us all about this classroom, right? What is it special. What's special about it?

**Nadine**

Well, there's a couple of funny stories for this classroom, but let's start with the description, shall we? So you will see around me there are desks and there are many desks that have been pushed aside just for the podcast. But we have 24 desks in the classrooms split into two different rooms or one huge room. So over my right shoulder you will see the room opening up.

So that wall is, I can move it. I can put it aside, put it at the back of the room so it opens up the room real big. And then I can use all of the features in this room that our audio video and our video to be able to, make sure that the trainer is seen by everyone in the classroom, which is great.

The desks are also. Oh, sorry. Did I interrupt you? No.

**Luna**

Go ahead. You were going to talk about the desk. What is what is interesting about these desks?

**Nadine**

Well, as I said last week and or last month in our last podcast, every single desk in this place, except for the one in the large boardroom where we were last week, is a sit stand desk. So they all come up and down. Even the one that we're sitting at today, it as it comes up and down, making it easy for people to work, kneeling down or standing up, sitting down, whichever they would like.

And the other feature for that is the chairs. We have every type of, not every, but we have about 20 different types of chairs in this room, so people can move them around and make sure that they're comfortable when they're going to sit here and listen to us all day while we're training. Right. And and I'm sure you'll be able to tell us about some of the courses that we give here.

But let me finish the description. How's that?

**Luna**

Absolutely.

**Nadine**

Thanks.

**Luna**

I know you have a special story to tell us about this.

**Nadine**

Oh, yes. This is my funny story. And okay, so the screen at the back of me, not the one directly in back, because that's part of the lending library stuff we're going to be showing. But at the back, the large screen, there's two of them and there's a third one coming in that will go on the pillar that's over my left shoulder.

And having that allows people to see everything that's going on. We can magnify on the screen. We can do all of these different things. The stands where the TVs are also go up and down so you can adjust and based on the trainer, based on the interactivity of the activity that you want to be able to do. So those are the main features in here.

And the other one that's the coolest in this I know I use cool a lot. It's it's my word. My grandkids think it's not the right one to use anymore. It's not modern, but it's still mine is the way that we plug in the desks. And that's where my funny story comes in. So let me show you the battery and then I'll go backwards in time.

So the battery looks like this. And each desk sits in the middle of the room, is charged with a battery. Why you asked? Well, here comes my story. The first time I walked into this room not too long ago, when before it was delivered, there were speed bumps on the floor and there was carpet. I came into this room and I said, this isn't going to work.

This is not accessible. And over every speed bump, Luna, guess what they had? They had a plug. Do you know how high the plug was? 3 to 4in off the floor. Can you imagine? Now we've told the story of the water fountain. I would have said the same thing with the plugs, right? I haven't driven people crazy because, you know, they were like, oh no, I can't.

There's a plug there. So I complained and talked to the facilities and accommodations people and they said, okay, Nadine, we'll find you a solution. And I oh, thank you. So they ripped up all the carpet and they installed different speed bumps. Notice the word speed bumps again. So I'm like nope, nope, this is not going to work. So we had a sticky floor because the carpet had been removed.

We had plugs. They they changed the plugs instead of being square and three three inches off the ground, they were circle and three inches off the ground. I'm like, this isn't going to work, guys. So then the next day into the office comes marching in about six or 7 or 8 people saying, Nadine, you're right, this isn't going to work.

So back to the drawing board. And then they said, okay, we're not going to put plugs in the wall. Perfect. So they changed the carpet. Now this beautiful floor and there's no carpet. There is no speed bumps, but there are desks, desks that need to be powered. Because when we give courses, we need the computers, we need the screens.

And just like, okay, what are we going to do? So creativity, one of the men that I work with in accommodations, his name is Benoit. So I'm going to call him out. He came up with this perfect solution. So that's why I'm showing the batteries. So each desk that is not close to a wall now is battery operated.

And if you look behind me past the screen there is a holder for the battery. So at the end of the day I take this battery that has a holder in the leg of the desk. I put it in the the charger, all six batteries at the same time, plug it in overnight and then we're done. So the next day all my batteries are charged.

All I have to do is sit them back in the cradle and I have power. No speed bumps. I was so very, very happy to have such an innovative solution. And I think we may be the only ones that have this solution right now.

**Luna**

That is fantastic. And you know what? That's telling me two things. It's telling me first that before you create a space, before you plan a space, you need to think about the people who are going to come into this space. And people come in different shapes and use different devices. So we need to think about that. And it is important to build accessibility in from the start.

But the second thing is telling me is that when you have people who are creative, who are flexible, who think out of the proverbial box, they we can find solutions. And these batteries are a perfect example of a solution that we couldn't have thought about. But that is so handy.

**Nadine**

So we're sure. Thanks, but no thank you Benoit

**Luna**

Well, wherever you are, I hope you get to to hear us thanking you because it was a great idea. And what are we going to do in this class? And what do we typically going to, train people on? We are hoping that pretty soon people will show up here for, training activities, for workshops, as interactives as we can make them.

And one of the topics, of course, is going to be a course for it professionals on how to use adaptive technology, but there's going to be much more document accessibility, culture change and so we just can't wait to have people coming in person. And it also lends itself to a hybrid mode as well.

**Nadine**

Excellent. I like how you answer your own question.

**Luna**

Yes. It's not good. Well, you know the best way to never contradict yourself and never argue with anyone is to ask your questions and answer them too.

**Nadine**

Well, you did that well. So how about how about we talk about the lending library for a bit? Because I think there's stuff that we have on the desk. There's things behind me and we also advertise for it. So maybe we should talk about it.

**Luna**

Absolutely. So we did advertise that we were going to talk about digital magnifiers, otherwise known as CCTV. That's what we called them in the old days. And so we've got three models to show you today. I am going to try to see if I can do this with one hand. So here's the smallest one of these, digital magnifiers.

And it is very small. It's about the size of a smartphone. It is pretty light. And what's the use case for a thing like this? Nadine, what do you think? We could use it for?

**Nadine**

Code that's off script. That's not the question I'm supposed to answer, but I think I can probably figure it out. So this is great because it's small, fits in my purse, it fits in my pocket, and sometimes things are written small. And unfortunately, I'm getting older and it's a lot easier to use something like this where if I'm looking for my desk, right.

So I've booked a desk and going to the office and the numbers are written really, really small in the bottom so that I can just shine at it. And I prefer watching looking at stuff in dark mode. So by using dark mode, this magnifier allows me to change the color. I can invert the colors, I can use them as yellow, I can change the color and you'll see it also on the bigger screen that's behind me.

So this one is really useful for little things. And one of the best use cases we have is we still have mail rooms in the government. Canada, and they all come in bins and there's numbers on those bins. So having something really, really small to follow to see which bin is where allows anybody to see those numbers. So it's really, really useful.

**Luna**

It's useful. And it is in some ways the fact that it's digital. It does project a light onto, the item that you're trying to read, and it makes reading much easier. And of course, the colors there's zooming in and out. Those are great benefits. We have a second and, kind of digital magnifier right on the desk.

It looks like a tablet, like, a commonly known, surface tablet, for example. It you can slide the document underneath. It has a stand and same idea you can it magnifies, it changes colors. You can have the background, dark or light. You can magnify more or less. It has a fantastic feature, which is it does optical character recognition.

So when you have the document, and you're trying to read it, if you want to maybe take a break or listen to what it says or etc., the this type of very portable still, digital magnifier allows you to do that. Some of these models also come with an additional camera that you can point at a distance.

So when Nadine was referring to the screens that we might use for training, somebody could sit at one of these desks, point their camera at the big screen, and see the screen magnified on their little screen of their tablets. So again, a super, super handy feature. You can take pictures and save them and look at them later. All kinds of neat aspects of this, these things.

And again, when do we want to use those in the workplace? You mentioned the mailroom. What would be other examples, other examples, that of use cases for these types of magnifiers, for example, can you think of.

**Nadine**

I can think of a few, but there's one interesting thing that you didn't mention today, because we haven't talked about it. Last time we did a podcast, we mentioned 3D printed stuff, right? This magnifier sits in the 3D printed stand. Did you know that? I think I forgot to tell you. So we did. We did print this. So use cases for a larger one that sits on the desk.

So we're going to be looking at different things. So let's use the mailroom as continue with that example. Have you ever received a package Luna from Canada Post or from Amazon or from anywhere.

**Luna**

If you only knew how that question could get me into trouble okay.

**Nadine**

So I will ask you to answer the question. But when we're doing finance in the government of Canada, one of the things that we have to do is we have to make sure that the packing slip goes and gets scanned in and things like that. So in order to verify how many boxes you take out, the packing slip, you make sure you have all your items.

Everything is always printed really, really small so you can put that on your desk. Look at your packing slip, make sure you have everything and it helps magnify the font characters. Because most of those packing slips and most of the documents that we read, especially forms, are written in six, 8 or 10 point font, which is really small.

So it's a really good example if we're going to keep the mailroom going. But there's still other jobs.

**Luna**

Lots of other jobs.

**Nadine**

But you know, just to.

**Luna**

Give like would bring you printed forms and you can check them out where you would have to actually print a physical signature on a form or complete a form by hand. This is a good way to do it, because you can slide your form under the under the screen. You can use your pen to write and you would see it on the screen.

So that's that's another use case.

**Nadine**

Excellent. So my turn to show you the last one. So it's the last one for today. Does that mean that I only have three in the inventory and there's only three available?

**Luna**

There are lots and lots of different models available in the market. For these kinds of, as we say, digital magnifiers. I'm always tempted to call them CCTV.

**Nadine**

Rounds, digital magnifier or CCTV. It's still the right thing. So this one is a lot better, a lot not better. Bigger is what I meant. I apologize for that because it can sit on a desk, but it has different features and the other one. So if you look at the one on the table, because you can see it beside Luna, you would notice that I would have to move the documents around to be able to read them, whereas this one has.

If you see the screen, the screen is quite large and I've changed the color, so it's very visible. So I have blue and yellow as my colors selected. And depending what people prefer they can do black and white. They can do white on black, they can do red and green. They can really customize the colors to how they would use them and where they would see them.

So you'll see that on the table. The table here has it moves. So you'll see we only have a small piece of paper. And I've put the AAACT business card on there so that you can see it in different colours. And by clicking the button here in the middle, that actually is a remote control. So I can actually control this at a distance.

So notice that now my magnifier is getting smaller and a bigger just by turning the loop on the, on the tool. And there's a variety of things. So it'll move on the x axis as we call it, so we can read. It'll move up and down. So you'll notice we did it on purpose. We put the eye chart here.

So you know that, you know we have the F and the P and they get smaller as you go down. And I've put the AAACT business card right in the middle. If I go all the way down to where there's a small line, the smallest line on the eye chart, I have two lines that I can put through it so that that line is right in between.

So it allows me to focus just on one thing. And again, if I wanted to magnify it, I could change the magnification level and, and do that. So a lot of times when different use cases for this one, now it's your turn. What are different use cases for this. Because this is really helpful. It is bigger. So it would be set up.

So we have a few set up in the office here in different desks so that people can use them and see how they work. In and a setting where you'd have an employee needing one of these, they probably set up in one place where they can use them, often or in their office.

**Luna**

In their office. Absolutely. One of the ways to use it is you can connect it also to your computer, so that it becomes a monitor for your computer. The other thing that I wanted to say for me, a great use case for this is a map or a floor plan, because they're usually printed on bigger paper.

It's not easy to manipulate, but with the moving table, we could, put it underneath and you could see the various aspects of the plan that would be really too small sometimes for for people. Right.

**Nadine**

That's excellent. So we can answer a lot of questions. We can also talk about this all day long. So but we made sure that this podcast was 30 minutes. So how about we, change into our other characters for today?

**Luna**

Today we're going to change identities. Isn't that interesting. So I am going to be called Star Remember my name is Luna, but I'm going to become Star and Star. I'm, this person's other person's friend. So Nadine is going to turn into Sky. So Star and Sky are good friends. They've known each other for a while, but they haven't seen each other in a bit.

And Sky has just took on a new role as a manager with a new team. And so she called me up, to ask me some questions, to use me a little bit as her sounding board. So hi Sky, how are you these days? And it's been a while since we've seen each other.

**Nadine**

Hi Star, I know we should never let that time go by because, you know, I really enjoyed talking to you, and we used to spend a lot more time together. But this new job has gotten me so busy that I haven't had as much time to reach out. So I think we are going to remedy that today.

**Luna**

How's that? Oh, absolutely. How are things going with your new team?

**Nadine**

They're fantastic. Love my new team. Things are going well. I've been here for a little bit and so far so good. But there is one thing I want to talk to you about now I'm getting get right into it so that, you know, we could do something later. And but this one has been weighing on my mind because I have an employee that brought me a letter from the doctor, and their letter from the doctor says that, she or.

No, they have to work 100% of the time in a telework situation, so I'm okay with that. But then last week, we had an all staff and this person came to work, and I'm like, wait a minute, how this doesn't make sense to me because logically, if you 100% telework, there's got to be a reason for it. So how do I approach this person and what kind of questions can I ask her?

Without delving into her personal life and without asking about her diagnostic or anything like that? And I'm struggling with the right questions to figure out what the barrier actually is.

**Luna**

Well, there are certainly ways to go about it is if your organization really putting an emphasis on people being in the office, a certain number of days per week. And is that what you're feeling that that need to make sure that your employees are around for sure.

**Nadine**

And I think it's important. Right. I'm as a manager and as a director or, you know, a supervisor, it's important to me to follow the directive of having people in the office. The other thing it does, it creates a different atmosphere. Sometimes when you're in the office, I have no issues working 100% from home. Don't get me wrong, I'm okay with that.

But sometimes having people in person brings a different dynamic, which could be interesting for this person as well, depending on what the barriers are. And I don't want to go against the barriers. I want to help. So I'm stuck between like a rock and a hard place where I want to please management, and I want to make sure that the employee doesn't have barriers so that they're comfortable and productive.

Because at the end of the day, if they're productive, I look good, I'm productive, and I'm meeting my obligations, for my objectives, for my work and for the return to office.

**Luna**

Absolutely. So I think the best place to start, where I would start to be really honest, is by having a very open conversation with the employee. So try to put her at ease or put them at ease. Make sure that they understand that the conversation is in a safe space and that you have a common objective, which is for her to be in the best position possible to do her job.

While meeting some operational requirements that we have, we all have to meet. So how can we find some common ground is what you're trying to do is to find some common ground. And remember, as a manager, you have a duty to accommodate, but you have a duty to provide an accommodation that's reasonable. It may not be 100% perfect, but it needs to be reasonable, which means it needs to work with the employee and it needs to work for you as well.

So that's the kind of conversation I would have with this employee setting her at ease in and trying to understand so you can ask some questions. As long as the questions are about the workplace and not about her personal life.

**Nadine**

So but she does go to the grocery store. Or maybe she does. Maybe she goes to the theater. One can't ask her those questions. To me, that would be logical. And can I ask her like, why did you come to work when there was a whole bunch of people like, well, how do I phrase it that it's not as direct, that it's, you know, kinder or or, you know.

**Luna**

Yes. More empathetic, of course. So you want to first of all, you want to make a distinction between the grocery or the theater and the all staff meeting. Because even though this means this employee is going to be in crowds and in noisy environments, which seem to be the barriers that they are facing, they are one or the other are different because one is a work situation, one is a personal situation.

You don't want to go there. What you want to talk about is the workplace, right? So one thing I would do is, okay, so how do you you you came to the all staff meeting. You came to some team, social activities. How do you feel about coming to these, activities? How do you prepare to come to these activities?

What do you do in order to be able to come to these activities? And if the person can describe what they do, then you're asking finally, you're asking them to tell you how they they find solutions to their barriers. And then you can discuss okay, so could we apply this type of approach to present regular presence in the workplace.

And you can consider various options you can offer for example, to check out which are the days where there's less people in the office, which are the days where there's less noise because people are doing different type of work. Where in the office location is it, calm, quieter environment, perhaps out of the traffic lanes where people tend to congregate, for example.

So all those kinds of of conversations you can have with them, because what you're doing is exploring options and trying to come to an agreement with the employee. You can also offer a gradual approach. Okay. An approach that would tend to, for example, say, okay, we can maybe start with one day a month, see how it works, we evaluate, etc..

I mean, there's all kinds of options, as you can see. I hope this helps.

**Nadine**

It certainly does. It gives me a lot of things to think of. And basically I'm going to start with a conversation with her. So I'm glad we could talk about work. And I love the advice that you're able to give me. But you know what? Let's change the mood again. And do you mind if we go for coffee and just not talk about work for a minute and be nice to catch up with you?

**Luna**

Absolutely. Let's go for a coffee. I know you don't like coffee, but we can certainly find something you like. And we can have a fantastic chat so we can magically turn back into I am Luna.

**Nadine**

I am Nadine.

**Luna**

And I am Luna, and it's a pleasure for us to have spent this half hour with you. I hope you found it interesting. Please don't hesitate to ask questions and to follow us. The work that we do at the Accessibility, Accommodation and Adaptive Computer Technology Program. Until next time. Thank you.

**Nadine**
