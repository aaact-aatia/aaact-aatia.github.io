  "Hello, this is the Canada Revenue Agency..." – yes, it’s really us this time! However, there are bad actors who will impersonate employees of the CRA and other government departments for fraud and scam attempts. Some scams are easy to spot, and some are not! In this episode, we continue with information to protect yourself from these attempts.

  On the previous episode, we met with the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre for tips on protecting yourself from fraud and scams. On this episode, we now meet with a CRA expert to discuss when and how the CRA may legitimately contact taxpayers, and how the CRA helps protect your information if you were scammed.

  We also meet with a member of the CRA’s marketing team, to talk about our efforts to inform Canadians about scams through the Be Scam Smart escape rooms you may have seen in malls across Canada in 2024.
