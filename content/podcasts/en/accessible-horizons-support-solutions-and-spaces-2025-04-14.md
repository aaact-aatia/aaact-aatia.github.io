  **Part 1: Showcasing 219 Laurier (10 min)**


  Discover the accessibility features of 219 Laurier, the AAACT program’s showcase space. In this episode, Luna and Nadine explore the design of the training room—an inclusive environment equipped with adaptive furniture, accessible technology, and thoughtful design elements that remove barriers and foster collaboration for all employees.


  **Part 2: AAACT’s Lending Library (10 min)**


  Explore the possibilities of low-cost adaptations through AAACT’s Lending Library. Luna and Nadine introduce digital magnifiers. What types are there? What do they do? What barriers do they address? How do they work and many other practical tips.


  **Part 3: Nadine and Luna: A conversation between two managers about more complex accommodation situations (10 min)**


  Manager 1 is seeking advice and “moral” support from a colleague about an employee who has listed several barriers in their Passport. They don’t really understand the requests, they want to ask for medical notes, they want to involve LR. Manager 2 offers good advice.



  Tune in to hear how accessibility is more than just tools and tech—it’s about people, creativity, and rethinking how we support one another in the workplace.
